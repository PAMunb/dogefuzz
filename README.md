# Dogefuzz: A flexible fuzzer to detect common vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts

## Setup with docker

First, run the docker-compose file to start the local EVM (geth) node and Vandal API server.

For Docker version >= v2.20.2:

```
docker compose -f ./infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

For previous Docker versions:

```
docker-compose -f ./infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Setup without docker (for debugging only)

First, you need to run vandal using docker: 

```
docker compose  -f "infra/docker-compose.yml" up -d --build vandal
```

Second, to run geth outside of docker, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo https://github.com/PAMunb/dogefuzz-enhanced-go-ethereum
2. Run the following commands inside the cloned dir
```
go run build/ci.go install -static ./cmd/geth
ln -s build/bin/geth geth
source ./vars_for_debuging_geth.sh
./entrypoint.sh
```

## Run and execute dogefuzz fuzzer

To build and run the fuzzer server (dogefuzz), run the following command:

```
go build ./cmd/dogefuzz && go run ./cmd/dogefuzz 
```

The server will start listening to port 3456 (default).
To configure the fuzzer behavior, look into the [config.json](config.json) file.

To execute a fuzzing process, here is an example of a request:

```
curl -X POST \
     http://localhost:3456/tasks \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{

    "contractName": "AddressLotteryV2",

```

It will execute the contract `AddressLotteryV2` contract per 15 minutes using the `directed_greybox` fuzzing strategy. And, it will try to detect the following weaknesses:

- delegate
- exception-disorder
- gasless-send
- number-dependency
- reentrancy
- timestamp-dependency

Available options for `fuzzingType` are:

- blackbox
- greybox
- directed_greybox

When no `arguments` are passed, the fuzzer will generate the constructor arguments.

The final report will be generated at the end of the fuzzing campaign and named `result.json`.

Note: The `contractSource` must be a JSON string, you can use sites and tools to do a JSON Stringify operation, as we need to convert CR/LF characters to their textual representation.

## Code Structure

1. ./assets/contracts - Directory where the agent's source code is located.
2. ./infra - Contains Docker files and Docker compose files.
